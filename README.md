# Learn just enough INTERNET PROGRAMMING to be dangerous

This book can be used as a course book for the Internet Programming course. It is also suitable for self-study.

The intended audience is students who have already taken an introductory programming course, so basic programming concepts are not explained in detail. The book is designed to be used in a classroom setting, and each chapter includes exercises that can be used for in-class activities or homework assignments.

The book assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables, loops, and functions, as well as basics of object-oriented programming. It also assumes basic familiarity with HTML and CSS. It does not go into detail about these topics, but rather focuses on how to use these concepts in the context of web programming.

The book covers the following topics:

- Introduction to the Internet and Web Programming
- Getting Started with JavaScript
- The browser as a development environment
